## üîç Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Homepage Authentication Flow**
   - All Sign In/Sign Up buttons successfully trigger Clerk authentication modals
   - Modal interactions work correctly
   - Proper keyboard navigation (ESC to close)

2. **Page Structure**
   - All pages load correctly
   - Components render properly
   - Responsive design works

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Playwright configuration is correct
   - Test helpers work effectively
   - Screenshot capture functioning
   - Report generation successful

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

1. **Authentication State**
   - Dashboard and Intelligence pages require authentication
   - Need to implement proper auth state management for protected routes
   - Consider using Clerk's test mode or mock authentication

2. **API Configuration**
   - Axiom logging service showing "Forbidden" errors
   - Missing environment variable: `CUSTOM_KEY`
   - Some API endpoints may need proper test configuration

3. **Test Execution**
   - Some tests timeout waiting for elements
   - Need to adjust timeouts for slower operations
   - Consider implementing retry logic for flaky tests

## üìà Coverage Analysis

### Button Click Coverage
| Page | Total Buttons | Tested | Coverage |
|------|--------------|---------|----------|
| Homepage | 4 | 4 | 100% |
| Dashboard | 7+ | 0* | 0%* |
| Intelligence | 10+ | 0* | 0%* |

*Requires authentication to test

### Feature Coverage
- ‚úÖ Authentication flows
- ‚úÖ Modal interactions
- ‚úÖ Navigation
- ‚è≥ API interactions (needs auth)
- ‚è≥ Data filtering (needs auth)
- ‚è≥ Search functionality (needs auth)

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Set up test authentication**

   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   CUSTOM_KEY=test-key
   AXIOM_TOKEN=test-token
   ```

3. **Add retry logic for flaky tests**
   ```javascript
   test.describe.configure({ retries: 2 });
   ```

### Future Enhancements
1. **Visual Regression Testing**
   - Add Percy or similar tool
   - Capture baseline screenshots
   - Compare on each run

2. **Performance Testing**
