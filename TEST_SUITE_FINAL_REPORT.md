## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### Code Changes
1. **packages/database/src/queries.ts**
   - Implemented conditional React cache import with fallback
   ```typescript
   let cache = typeof React !== 'undefined' ? React.cache : (fn) => fn;
   ```

2. **packages/shared/src/index.ts**
   - Enhanced normalizeCompanyName function
   - Handles company suffixes (Inc., LLC, Corp.)
   - Properly normalizes special characters (&, and)

3. **packages/ai/src/claude-extractor.ts**
   - Made getSystemPrompt() method public for testing

4. **tests/setup.ts**
   - Added comprehensive axiomLogger mock
   - Configured environment variables
   - Set up console mocking

### Test Infrastructure
- Created proper mock functions for OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs
- Fixed Supabase client mock chains
- Added integration test suite for end-to-end validation
- Configured test timeouts for async operations

## 📈 Coverage Analysis

### Tested Components
- ✅ Company deduplication and normalization
- ✅ Database client initialization
- ✅ AI service instantiation
- ✅ Schema validation
- ✅ Core module imports
- ⚠️ Embedding generation (partial)
- ⚠️ Company extraction (partial)

### Coverage by Package
- **@substack-intelligence/shared**: High coverage (>80%)
- **@substack-intelligence/database**: Moderate coverage (~60%)
- **@substack-intelligence/ai**: Partial coverage (~40%)

## 🚀 Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Fix Anthropic SDK Mocks**
   - Update mock structure to match actual SDK
   - Ensure proper promise resolution

2. **Fix Embedding Service Async Tests**
   - Resolve timeout issues in batch operations
   - Fix mock chain for complex queries

### Medium Priority
1. **Add More Integration Tests**
   - Real API interaction tests (with test keys)
   - Database operation tests
   - Error handling scenarios

2. **Improve Test Performance**
   - Optimize mock setup/teardown
   - Parallel test execution
   - Reduce redundant operations

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation**
   - Test writing guidelines
   - Mock pattern documentation
   - Coverage goals and strategies

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Run `pnpm test:run` to verify current status
   - Focus on fixing the 8 remaining failures
   - Target 90% test pass rate

2. **Best Practices**
   - Always run tests before committing
   - Maintain test coverage above 70%
   - Write tests for new features
   - Keep mocks synchronized with actual APIs

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Set up automated test runs on PR
   - Enforce minimum coverage thresholds
   - Block merges on test failures
